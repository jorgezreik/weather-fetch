## Prerequisites

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Running

Visit the live version.

But if you want to run locally, first run `npm i`

You also have to create a .env file and put your OpenWeather API key in the file, as below:

```properties
API_KEY = <key_here>
```

## Purpose

To practise using Node.js and making external API calls. Also practise for publishing to Heroku and hiding API keys through environment variables.
